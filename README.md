# Sound Galaxy
An audio visualizer adapted from https://executebig.notion.site/Mini-1-Sound-Galaxy-bf5eb59488b54c2ab4a0a088499153d0 to use Rust.

## Usage
Download from releases or compile from source. By default, it will play the audio file named input.mp3 in your current directory. To play another file, just write the path of the file in as the first argument when executing from a terminal.
